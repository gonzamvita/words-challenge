# words-challenge

You have a variable array of words (1000+ words, use /usr/share/dict/words or anything else if you’re not on a `*nix`), now we want to display those words on a webpage as “tags” in a field which should display no more than 100 characters per row.

Create an algorithm that puts words in a max 100 character line length. Sort the words so as many rows as possible fits within or as close as possible to that 100 character limit per row.

Display the words on a SPA in any way you like within the constraints.
